<div class="body refbody"><p class="shortdesc">Key points to consider when you plan the messaging aspects
of your <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> solution.</p>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Protocols</h2><p class="p"><span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> natively provides support for
MQTT and JMS, and can convert between the two protocols. You
must consider which protocols are appropriate for your business needs.
For more information about the supported protocols, see <a class="xref" href="../Overview/ov00050.html" title="Protocols that are supported by Eclipse Amlen.">Supported protocols</a>. For more information about
converting between the protocols, see <a class="xref" href="pl00005.html" title="When messages are converted between MQTT and JMS, there is a set of rules that are applied to the conversion.">Conversion between
MQTT and JMS</a>. </p><p class="p">MQTT and JMS support different qualities
of service. In general, higher qualities of service are slower than
lower qualities of service. For more information about the way MQTT
and JMS handle the delivery of messages, see <a class="xref" href="ov00102_.html" title="Eclipse Amlen natively supports MQTT and JMS protocols.">Message delivery</a>.</p></section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Message size</h2><p class="p">If you send large messages
with a high quality of service level, the <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> server cannot
store many messages before the available storage is filled. Consider
the volume and size of the messages you want to send, and whether
the messages must be persistent. These decisions affect the number
of messages that <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> can
handle.</p><p class="p">You can limit the message size that is allowed to be
sent through the <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> by
using the <code class="ph codeph">maximum message size</code> attribute of an endpoint.
For more information about endpoints, see <a class="xref" href="../Overview/ov00060.html" title="Message hubs are an organizational configuration object that collects endpoints, connection policies, and messaging policies that are associated with a specific goal into a single place. You can create a message hub per application to organize the endpoints and policies each application uses.">Message hubs, endpoints, and policies</a>.</p></section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Message count</h2><p class="p">For publish/subscribe messaging,
you can configure how many messages the <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> server stores,
by setting the <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages</code> attribute of a messaging
policy. The server stores the messages until the messages are received
by subscribers at the reliability level required. If a subscriber
that requires an exactly once level of reliability cannot be reached,
the message is stored.</p><p class="p">You can choose what happens when the
maximum message count is reached by using the <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages
Behavior</code> attribute of a messaging policy. You can either
reject new messages, or you can discard a percentage of old messages
that are stored on the server. If you choose to reject new messages,
and the maximum message count is reached, messages cannot be sent.
If you choose to discard old messages, and the maximum message count
is reached, old messages are removed from the server. Any messages
that are being delivered, that is, messages that are sent but not
yet acknowledged, are not removed. If a retained message is one of
the old messages, it is removed. The quality of service, persistence,
and priority of the messages does not prevent the messages from being
removed. Therefore, if all messages must be received in order for
your applications to function correctly, you cannot set the max messages
behavior to discard old messages. You must consider which behavior
to use, based on your messaging requirements.</p><p class="p">For more information
about messaging policies, see <a class="xref" href="../Security/se00004_.html" title="You can use messaging policies to authorize client messaging. There are three types of messaging policies: Topic policies, queue policies, and subscription policies.">Authorizing client messaging</a>.</p></section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Max Messages Behavior </h2><p class="p">You can choose what
happens when the maximum message count is reached by using the <code class="ph codeph">Max
Messages Behavior</code> attribute of a messaging policy. You can
either reject new messages, or you can discard a percentage of old
messages that are stored on the server. If you choose to reject new
messages, and the maximum message count is reached, messages cannot
be sent. If you choose to discard old messages, and the maximum message
count is reached, old messages are removed from the server. Any messages
that are being delivered, that is, messages that are sent but not
yet acknowledged, are not removed. If a retained message is one of
the old messages, it is removed. The quality of service, persistence,
and priority of the messages does not prevent the messages from being
removed. Therefore, if all messages must be received in order for
your applications to function correctly, you cannot set the max messages
behavior to discard old messages. You must consider which behavior
to use, based on your messaging requirements.</p><div class="p">The value of Max Messages Behavior is determined by the messaging policy that is associated with the subscription. To determine the messaging policy that is associated with the subscription, you can either use the <span class="ph uicontrol">Monitoring</span> page in the <span class="ph">Amlen WebUI</span>, or the REST API GET method with the following <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> URI:<pre class="pre codeblock"><code>http://&lt;admin-endpoint-IP:Port&gt;/ima/v1/monitor/Subscription</code></pre><ul class="ul">
<li class="li">For non-durable shared subscriptions, <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages Behavior</code> is determined by the value set for the subscriber that created the shared subscription. The setting applies to all subsequent subscribers, regardless of their own setting of <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages Behavior</code>. If the subscription is deleted, perhaps because all subscribers disconnected, and then is re-created by a different subscriber, the subscription might have a different setting for <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages Behavior</code>.</li>
<li class="li">For durable shared subscriptions, <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages Behavior</code> is determined by the value set for the subscriber that created the durable shared subscription. </li>
<li class="li">For global-shared durable subscriptions, <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages Behavior</code> is determined by the value set on the messaging policy with a type of <code class="ph codeph">Subscription</code> for the subscriber that created the global-shared durable subscription. </li>
<li class="li">For all types of subscriptions, you can update <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages Behavior</code> on the associated messaging policy; all subscriptions that are associated with that messaging policy are then updated to use the new value.</li>
</ul></div><p class="p">The use of wildcard characters is significant. A number
of different subscriptions that are using different messaging policies
with different values of <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages Behavior</code> can
subscribe to the same topic at the same time; they are part of the
same topic community. It is the value of the <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages
Behavior</code> attribute of the subscription the buffer of which
is full at the time of a publish that dictates the behavior for the
entire topic community. A subscription that is using a messaging policy
with a value of <code class="ph codeph">Reject New Messages</code> in the <code class="ph codeph">Max
Messages Behavior</code> attribute causes publish requests to fail
when its buffer becomes full. Even if other subscriptions in the topic
community are using messaging policies with a value of <code class="ph codeph">Discard
Old Messages</code> in the <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages Behavior</code> attribute,
their publish requests fail.</p><div class="p">Consider the following example
scenarios:<ol class="ol">
<li class="li"><p class="p">There are a number of subscriptions to the topic <code class="ph codeph">/RiverGauges/*</code>;
note the use of the wildcard. The buffer of one of these subscriptions
becomes full. It is using a messaging policy with a <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages
Behavior</code> attribute set to <code class="ph codeph">Reject New Messages</code>.
All publish requests to any topic in the <code class="ph codeph">/RiverGauges/*</code> topic
community fail. Even if other subscriptions are using messaging policies
with a <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages Behavior</code> attribute set to <code class="ph codeph">Discard
Old Messages</code>, publish requests fail. Publish requests continue
to fail until the subscriber with the full buffer starts to receive
messages and space is created in its buffer.</p><p class="p">If, however, the
setting of the <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages Behavior</code> attribute of
the subscription to the topic <code class="ph codeph">/RiverGauges/*</code> is set
to <code class="ph codeph">Discard Old Messages</code>, and its buffer becomes full,
other subscriptions are not affected. Messages are deleted from the
buffer of the subscriber with the full buffer. Gaps in the incoming
message stream might be experienced as a result of messages being
deleted from its buffer.</p></li>
<li class="li"><p class="p">There are a number of subscriptions to the <code class="ph codeph">/RiverGauges/Mississippi</code> topic.

publish requests fail. All subscriptions to the <code class="ph codeph">/RiverGauges/Mississippi</code> topic
cannot receive any new messages. Subscriptions to the <code class="ph codeph">/RiverGauges/*</code> topic
community continue to receive messages for all topics except for messages

</ol> </div><p class="p">If you choose to discard old messages, the quality of
service, persistence, priority, expiry status, and reliability of
the messages are not considered and do not prevent the messages from
being removed.</p><p class="p">To be published successfully, MQTT messages with
QoS of 1 or 2, or JMS messages with the equivalent qualities of service,
must be sent to all subscriptions in the topic community. If a subscription
has a full buffer and a <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages Behavior</code> attribute
set to <code class="ph codeph">Discard Old Messages</code>, the message is always
accepted and then, if necessary, messages in the buffer are discarded.
If the <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages Behavior</code> attribute is set to <code class="ph codeph">Reject
New Messages</code>, the publish request fails for all subscriptions
in the topic community.</p><p class="p">If MQTT messages with QoS of 0, or JMS
messages with the equivalent quality of service, are sent to a subscription
that has a full buffer and a <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages Behavior</code> attribute
set to <code class="ph codeph">Discard Old Messages</code>, the publish request
succeeds but some existing messages are discarded from the buffer. If
the <code class="ph codeph">Max Messages Behavior</code> attribute is set to <code class="ph codeph">Reject
New Messages</code>, the publish request succeeds but other incoming
messages are rejected.</p></section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Message order</h2><div class="p">If the message arrival order
is important to your solution, you must configure your solution to
ensure that message order is preserved. To preserve the message order,
your solution must meet the following requirements:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">The producer or publisher must be single threaded.</li>
<li class="li">Messages must be exchanged with the same quality of service.</li>
<li class="li">If you are using <span class="ph">MQ Connectivity</span>, you must
map to a single queue manager.</li>
<li class="li">For publish/subscribe systems, the messages must be published
to a single topic.</li>
</ul></div></section>

<dt class="dt dlterm">Maximum number of topic levels</dt>
<dd class="dd"><span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> limits

</dl></section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Retained messages</h2><p class="p">You can use retained messages
to send the most recent message to subscribers that subscribe after
that message was published.</p><p class="p">Only one message is retained for
each topic, so existing retained messages are deleted when a new retained
message is published to the topic. The deletion of the existing message
might not occur synchronously with the arrival of the new retained
message. In the case where more than one publisher publishes retained
messages to a single topic, it is not possible to know which message
is stored. It is possible that an earlier message sent by one publisher
is stored as the retained message, rather than a later message sent
by another publisher. Therefore, where possible, have no more than
one publisher sending retained messages to a topic.</p><p class="p">Messages
are not retained after <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> is
restarted if the messages are not sent as persistent retained messages.
Consider sending retained messages as persistent messages so that
the messages continue to be available to new subscribers even if <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> is restarted.</p></section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Messaging users and groups</h2><p class="p">When you create messaging policies and connection policies, you can restrict access based on messaging user ID and messaging group membership. You can use an LDAP server connection to provide the details of the users and groups. You can connect only one LDAP server to <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span>. Therefore, you must consider how your existing infrastructure might be used for messaging users and groups.</p><p class="p">When you use the <code class="ph codeph">${GroupID}</code> variable
in your messaging policies, ensure that, where the same user ID is
being used in more than one group with the same group ID and the user
ID is referring to different users, you consider having unique group IDs.
Unique group IDs help to ensure that access is restricted to only
those users that are intended to have access. For more information
about using variable substitution, see <a class="xref" href="../Security/se00018.html" title="You can use variable substitution in messaging policies to avoid configuring large numbers of messaging policies. You can set up a topic policy or queue policy so that the topic or queue parameter in the policy includes a user ID, group ID, client ID, or client certificate common name variable. The user ID, group ID, client ID, or common name is matched to the topic string or queue name, and access is granted to that topic tree or queue only.">Variable substitution in messaging policies</a>.</p></section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Expired messages</h2><p class="p">If it is important that subscribing client applications do not process expired messages, it is
    good practice for the subscribing client application to check the expiry time of messages that
    they receive from the client. The subscribing client application can then discard those messages
    that have expired. If the subscribing client application needs to perform this check of expiry
    time, it is important that the subscriber host clock is synchronized with the <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> server host clock. Synchronization of the
    clocks is required for the expiration check to work correctly. Use a network time protocol (NTP)
    server to keep the clocks synchronized. </p></section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">LTPA or OAuth authentication</h2><p class="p">For clients that depend on LTPA or OAuth authentication, it is important that <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> server time is synchronized with the LTPA
    token provider or OAuth token provider. The authentication request from the <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> client might fail because of the expiry of the
    LTPA token or OAuth token if the clocks are not synchronized. </p></section>

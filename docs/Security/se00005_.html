<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">As an administrator, you can use certificate profiles and
security profiles to configure Transport Layer Security (TLS) for <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> endpoints. </p>
<p class="p">TLS is controlled by the security profile that is associated with
an endpoint. A security profile defines the security operations that
are applied to a message flow. If TLS is enabled, the security profile
must have an associated certificate profile that defines the server
certificate to use. Server certificates protect against impersonation,
certifying that a public key belongs to a specified entity. </p>
<p class="p">You can also disable TLS in a security profile. You might consider
disabling TLS for communication that occurs behind a firewall. For
example, if TLS traffic is managed by load balancers, you might choose
to disable TLS for communication between the load balancers and <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span>. Disabling TLS
can lead to improved performance in <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> when TLS is already
operating on communication outside the firewall. For more information
about enabling and disabling TLS in <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span>, see <a class="xref" href="../Administering/ad00740_.html" title="A security profile is used by an endpoint to define authentication and Transport Layer Security (TLS) settings for that endpoint. To enable TLS for the endpoint, you must enable TLS in the security profile and the security profile must have an associated certificate profile that defines the server certificate that is used to control TLS. To create a security profile with TLS enabled, you must create the certificate profile before you create the security profile. You can configure security profiles either by using the Amlen WebUI or by using REST Administration APIs.">Configuring security profiles</a>.</p>
<p class="p">TLS can be configured within an endpoint if the endpoint specifies
a security profile. Endpoints are associated with message hubs and
control how clients can connect to <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span>. Each endpoint
can specify a security profile. The security profile determines the
client authentication method and whether TLS is used. If TLS is enabled,
then the TLS configuration settings in the security profile are used.</p>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Configuring certificates</h2><p class="p">What is a certificate?
Certificates can be called public key certificates, digital certificates
or identity certificates. Digital certificates are digitally signed
data structures that bind public keys to subjects by a trusted certificate
authority or certification authority.  </p><div class="p">Complete the following
steps to configure TLS on <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span>:<ol class="ol">
<li class="li">Upload a certificate and create a certificate profile.<p class="p">A certificate
profile defines the certificate, associated key, and any password
that is used by an endpoint to establish a secured connection from
a client. You need only one certificate profile for each certificate
and key pair. The certificate in the profile is used during the SSL
handshake between a client and an endpoint. The certificate verifies
to the client that it is communicating with <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span>, and not with
an unknown server.</p><p class="p">The certificate must be a PEM format certificate,
and the associated private key must be an RSA private key. If you
have root and intermediate CA certificates, you can combine these
certificates into a single file with the server certificate to create
a trust chain. Upload the single file as the certificate file.</p><p class="p">For
information about certificates, and how to obtain certificates, see <a class="xref" href="../Reference/_Topics/sy10530_.html" title="Digital certificates protect against impersonation, certifying that a public key belongs to a specified entity. They are issued by a Certificate Authority.">Digital certificates</a>.</p><p class="p">For more information about creating
a certificate profile, see <a class="xref" href="../Administering/ad00700_.html" title="You can configure a number of security components. You can configure certificate profiles and security profiles to secure your endpoints. You can upload client certificates to the Eclipse Amlen truststore. You can configure Lightweight Third Party Authentication (LTPA) and OAuth. You can enable FIPS-compliant security. All these security components can be configured either by using the Amlen WebUI or by using REST Administration APIs.">Configuring security</a>.</p></li>
<li class="li">Create a security profile with TLS enabled and specify the certificate
profile that you created. A certificate profile can be associated
with one or more security profiles. You can associate a security profile
with one or more endpoints. In addition to the certificate profile,
the security profile defines the TLS configuration properties to secure
communications with an endpoint:<dl class="dl">
<dt class="dt dlterm">Minimum protocol method</dt>
<dd class="dd">TLS provides secure communication for messages that flow between the client and <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span>. The <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> supports multiple encryption versions: TLS v1, TLS v1.1, TLS v1.2. <p class="p">The different version levels of TLS show the progression of standards. Each new version modifies the client and server interchanges, and adds or removes ciphers to the support list. To make a connection between the client and <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span>, the same version must be supported by both the client and <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span>. For best security, use as high a version as possible. For best compatibility, support as many versions as possible. By selecting a minimum version, clients can connect with that minimum version, and all of the newer versions.</p><p class="p">If you use TLS v1.0, use <kbd class="ph userinput">Medium</kbd> level ciphers with <span class="keyword parmname">UseClientCipher</span> set to <kbd class="ph userinput">false</kbd>. This setting ensures that the cipher is chosen from a list of client-supported ciphers that are stored on the server. Alternatively, use <kbd class="ph userinput">Medium</kbd> level ciphers with newer browsers. </p><p class="p">TLS v1.1 can be used as the lowest version, if all of the clients are updated to support it. You might choose this version at edge of network, and for high value information provided it is acceptable to not allow older clients. </p><p class="p">TLS v1.2 adds a set of improved and higher bit count ciphers. TLS v1.2 offers the best security from the versions listed. However, this version might have problems with compatibility as many clients do not support this version. TLS v1.2 is the best choice in a controlled client and server environment, where all of the clients are known to run on newer systems.</p></dd>

<dt class="dt dlterm">Ciphers </dt>
<dd class="dd">Ciphers specify the encryption algorithm used.<p class="p">Organizations often have rules for the quality
          of ciphers used. Setting the cipher to <kbd class="ph userinput">Best</kbd>, selects ciphers that
          are supported by both the client and server, in order of quality. As a result, the higher
          bit count ciphers that are slower to process are selected. Setting the cipher to
           <kbd class="ph userinput">Fast</kbd> selects lower bit count ciphers ahead of the highest-quality
          ciphers. Setting the cipher to <kbd class="ph userinput">Fast</kbd> improves performance with
          little loss of security. Setting the cipher to <kbd class="ph userinput">Medium</kbd> selects lower
          bit count ciphers that can be used with TLS v1.0, even with older browsers.</p><p class="p">The
          cipher can be selected by either the server or the client. If you set
           <span class="keyword parmname">UseClientCipher</span> to <kbd class="ph userinput">true</kbd>, then the cipher is
          selected by the client. Using <kbd class="ph userinput">Best</kbd> or <kbd class="ph userinput">Fast</kbd>
          sets the supported cipher list to the list of high-quality ciphers. If client is selected,
           <kbd class="ph userinput">Best</kbd> and <kbd class="ph userinput">Fast</kbd> are the same because the
          first supported cipher in the client list of high-quality ciphers is selected. If you set
           <span class="keyword parmname">UseClientCipher</span> to <kbd class="ph userinput">False</kbd>, then the cipher is
          selected by the server. The server chooses the cipher to use from the list of ciphers that
          the client supports. If you specify <kbd class="ph userinput">Best</kbd>, then the cipher is
          selected in strength order from the high-quality cipher list. If you specify
           <kbd class="ph userinput">Fast</kbd>, then the fastest supported cipher from the high-quality
          cipher list is selected. </p><p class="p">For a complete list of ciphers that are used by <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span>, see <a class="xref" href="../Reference/_Topics/re00003_.html" title="You can use ciphers to specify the encryption algorithm that is used by the security policy.">Supported cipher lists</a>.</p></dd>

<dt class="dt dlterm">Use Client Ciphers</dt>
<dd class="dd">Specifies whether the client can determine the cipher use when
it connects to <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span>.
Only the ciphers that are supported by both client and server can
be chosen. If <code class="ph codeph">Use Client Ciphers</code> is specified, then
the client selects the cipher that is used to connect to <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span>. If <code class="ph codeph">Use
Client Ciphers</code> is not specified, then the server selects
the cipher.</dd>

<dt class="dt dlterm">Client Certificate Authentication</dt>

<h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title1">Developing retained message applications</h1>

<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The publisher of a message can specify that a copy of the
message must be kept on <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> as a retained
message. This retained message is sent to any subscribers that subscribe
after the message was published. <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> supports both
MQTT and JMS retained messages.</p>
<p class="p">Only one message is retained for each topic, so existing retained
messages are deleted when a new retained message is published to the
topic. The deletion of the existing message might not occur synchronously
with the arrival of the new retained message. In the case where more
than one publisher publishes retained messages to a single topic,
it is not possible to know which message is stored. It is possible
that an earlier message sent by one publisher is stored as the retained
message, rather than a later message sent by another publisher. Therefore,
where possible, have no more than one publisher sending retained messages
to a topic.</p>
<p class="p">Messages are not retained after <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> is restarted
if the retained messages are not sent as persistent messages. Consider
sending retained messages as persistent messages so that the messages
continue to be available to new subscribers even if <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> is restarted.
For more information about persistent messages, see <a class="xref" href="../Planning/ov00102_.html" title="Eclipse Amlen natively supports MQTT and JMS protocols.">Message delivery</a>.</p>
<div class="p">When you develop applications that use retained messages, consider
whether to use durable or non-durable subscriptions: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">For non-durable subscriptions, if a client disconnects and reconnects
to a topic, reconnecting creates a new subscription. Therefore, the
retained message on the topic that is subscribed to is sent to the
client, even if the client received the message before it disconnected.</li>
<li class="li">For durable subscriptions, if a client disconnects and reconnects,
reconnecting uses the same durable subscription. Messages that were
published after the client disconnected are delivered as normal, not
as retained messages. The only instance in which an application with
a durable subscription receives retained messages is when the subscription
is first created. If the application disconnects before it receives
the initial retained messages, the messages are delivered as retained
messages when the application reconnects.</li>
</ul>You can create a durable subscription in MQTT by using the <code class="ph codeph">cleanSession=0</code> flag.</div>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">MQTT retained messages</h2><p class="p">MQTT applications
can be configured to use retained messages by setting the <code class="ph codeph">RETAIN</code> flag.
When a subscriber receives a message with the <code class="ph codeph">RETAIN</code> flag
set, it indicates that the message is not being delivered at the time
of publication. Retained messages that are delivered at the time of
publication are delivered without the <code class="ph codeph">RETAIN</code> flag
set.</p><p class="p">With <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span>,
you can clear an MQTT retained message from a topic by sending a retained
message with a zero length payload. The message is delivered normally,
and the current retained message is cleared.</p></section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">JMS retained messages</h2><p class="p">JMS applications that
are developed for <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> can
be configured to use retained messages by setting the integer property <code class="ph codeph">JMS_IBM_Retain</code> to
the value <code class="ph codeph">1</code>. When a subscriber receives a message
with the <code class="ph codeph">JMS_IBM_Retain</code> property set to the value <code class="ph codeph">1</code>,
it indicates that the message was published and marked as retained
before the subscription was made. Retained messages that are delivered
at the time of publication are delivered with the value set to <code class="ph codeph">0</code>. </p><p class="p">If
retained messages are published to a queue, the retained flag is ignored.
Retained messages cannot be cleared. Publishing a zero-length, empty,
or null JMS message does not clear a retained message. However, as
the mechanism for retained messages is the same for JMS and MQTT,
you can send a zero-length MQTT retained message to delete the JMS
retained message.</p><p class="p">If a JMS retained message is sent with a message
expiry, the retained message is deleted after the expiration time. </p><p class="p">If
a JMS subscription uses the <code class="ph codeph">noLocal=True</code> setting,
any retained messages that were previously published by the same connection
are delivered to the subscriber. Only messages that are delivered
at the time of publication are filtered out by the <code class="ph codeph">noLocal=True</code> setting.</p></section>

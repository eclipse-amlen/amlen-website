<h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title1">Backup and restore</h1>

<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">System administrators can create a secure backup that can be used to restore the <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> configuration and, optionally, store data.
      The backup data can be used to copy data from one server to another, or used to restore data
      to the same server.</p>
<p class="p">You can back up and restore the <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span>
   configuration and store data only by using REST Administration APIs.</p>
<p class="p">The <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> data that is backed up includes users,
         passwords, certificates, message hubs, endpoints, queues, policies, queue manager
         connections, and destination mapping rules. It also includes server configuration
         information, such as high availability. Unless you back up the store, the data does not
         include any subscriptions or message data, such as messages that are on queues, or messages
         that are buffered for subscription. For more information about how to create a backup, see
            <a class="xref" href="ba00001_.html" title="System administrators can create a secure backup of the Eclipse Amlen messaging server by using REST Administration APIs and standard system tools.">Creating a backup of the Eclipse Amlen messaging server</a>.</p>
<p class="p">The backup process produces a file that is named <code class="ph codeph">imaBackup.<var class="keyword varname">hhmmss-MMDDYYYY</var></code>.
You can also choose to back up the store data. If you back up the
store data, the backup process produces an additional file that you
name; ensure that the name that you specify for the store backup file
is different than the <code class="ph codeph">imaBackup.<var class="keyword varname">hhmmss-MMDDYYYY</var></code> file
name. The store backup file is created on another machine as specified
by you. The backup process creates an association between the <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> backup file and
the store backup file; you cannot use a different <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> backup file with
the store data backup file.</p>
<div class="p">The <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> data
can be restored in one of two ways:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">You can restore all the <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> data and store,
               including the server configuration information.<p class="p">With this type of restore, you can
                  restore the data and configuration of the server that was backed up. This restore
                  might be used if the data was lost, or
                  corrupted.</p><p class="p">For
                  more information about how to restore data, including the server configuration
                  information, see <a class="xref" href="ba00002_.html" title="System administrators can restore the Eclipse Amlen server by using backed-up data in the same environment in which the backup operation was performed.">Restoring the Eclipse Amlen server from a backup in the same environment</a></p></li>
<li class="li">You can restore the <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> data and store,
               excluding the server configuration information.<p class="p">With this type of restore, you can
                  copy the data to a different server. This restore might be used for copying data
                  from a test system to a production system.
               </p></li>
</ul></div>
<div class="p">In both types of restore operation, unless you are using a backed
up version of the store, you must clean the store. Cleaning the store
deletes all persistent data, including messages, subscriptions, and
client states. If you are using a backed up version of the store,
consider that:<ul class="ul">
<li class="li">All messages that were buffered in the store after the store was
backed up are lost. </li>
<li class="li">Retained messages that were sent after the store was backed up
are lost.</li>
<li class="li">Messages that were in store buffers when the store was backed
up, and which were sent later and discarded from the store, are restored
and resent when subscribers reconnect. They are not marked as duplicate
messages for JMS and MQTT.</li>
<li class="li">Retained messages that were replaced after the store was backed
up are restored. The messages that replaced the retained messages
are lost.</li>
</ul></div>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">High availability environments</h2><p class="p">In a high availability (HA) environment, two servers are configured as an HA pair so that, if one of the servers (the primary) fails due to a planned or unplanned outage, the other server (the standby) can take over as the primary and messages can continue to be processed.</p>
         <p class="p">For information about recovering from an server failure in an HA
            environment, see the information about the different HA scenarios in <a class="xref" href="../Administering/ad00416_.html" title="The following scenarios assume that you are configuring your servers to run as an HA pair automatically, by enabling High Availability and by using the High Availability Group setting.">High availability scenarios</a>.  </p><p class="p">The
facility to back up and restore the HA environment is useful for disaster
recovery planning and for deploying new HA environments. For information
about backing up and restoring in an HA environment, see <a class="xref" href="ba00004_.html" title="The backup and restore of a high availability (HA) environment needs to be a coordinated process between the servers in an HA pair.">Backup and restore in a high availability environment</a>.</p></section>

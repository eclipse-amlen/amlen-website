<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Digital certificates protect against impersonation,
certifying that a public key belongs to a specified entity. They are
issued by a Certificate Authority.</p>
<div class="p">Digital certificates provide protection against impersonation,
because a digital certificate binds a public key to its owner, whether
that owner is an individual, or some other entity. Digital certificates
are also known as public key certificates, because they give you assurances
about the ownership of a public key when you use an asymmetric key
scheme. A digital certificate contains the public key for an entity
and is a statement that the public key belongs to that entity: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">When the certificate is for an individual entity, the certificate
is called a <dfn class="term">personal certificate</dfn> or <dfn class="term">user certificate</dfn>.</li>
<li class="li">When the certificate is for a Certificate Authority, the certificate
is called a <dfn class="term">CA certificate</dfn> or <dfn class="term">signer certificate</dfn>.</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="p">If public keys are sent directly by their owner to another entity,
there is a risk that the message could be intercepted and the public
key substituted by another. This is known as a <dfn class="term">man in the middle
attack</dfn>. The solution to this problem is to exchange public
keys through a trusted third party, giving you a strong assurance
that the public key really belongs to the entity with which you are
communicating. Instead of sending your public key directly, you ask
the trusted third party to incorporate it into a digital certificate.
The trusted third party that issues digital certificates is called
a Certificate Authority (CA), as described in <a class="xref" href="sy10560_.html" title="A Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted third party that issues digital certificates to provide you with an assurance that the public key of an entity truly belongs to that entity.">Certificate Authorities</a>.</p>

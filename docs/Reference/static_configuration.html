    The static configuration file allows manual configuration of the server. The 
    configuration is loaded when the server starts, any modification to the configuration 
    requires the server to be stopped and restarted. Settings for High Availability (HA)

        <p class="p"> 
          The SNMP port can only be configured manually by commenting out the 
          <span class="keyword option">SNMPPort</span> directive in <span class="ph filepath">server.cfg </span> 
          and setting it to the port number that you want to use. The
          default value for the subagent port is <kbd class="ph userinput">705</kbd>.

        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">HA.AllowSingleNIC</h2>
        <p class="p">
          When configuring High Availability, a redundant network connection is required. 
          This is typically done by specifying the Discovery interface and Replication 
          interface to use different subnets. If using an aggregated link redundancy is 
          handled at the Operating System level and it will appear as a single Network 
          Interface Card. 
        </p><p class="p">
          Setting <span class="keyword option">HA.AllowSingleNIC</span> to 1 removes policing and allows the
          Discovery Interface and Replication Interface to be on the same subnet.

        <section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">HA.SplitBrainPolicy</h2>
        <p class="p">
          If a High Availabilitiy pair encounters a Split Brain situation (see 
          <a class="xref" href="../Troubleshooting/tr00015_.html" title="In an HA pair, there can only be one primary node providing messaging operations. If the member acting as a primary detects that the other server is acting as a primary, it results in a split brain condition.">High availability problems</a>) manual intervention from an 
          Administrator is required to choose the appropriate Primary server.
        </p><p class="p">
          To allow the pair to choose a primary server itself set the 
          HA.SplitBrainPolicy to 1. Under this policy the server with the largest number
          of active connections will become the primary server. In the event of a tie the
          server with the highest session count will become the primary server. If there 
          is still a tie then neither server will become the primary and manual intervention
          is required.

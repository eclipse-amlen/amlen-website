<h1 class="title topictitle1" id="ariaid-title1">Publish/Subscribe</h1>

<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Publish/subscribe is the mechanism by which subscribers
can receive information, in the form of messages, from publishers. </p>
<p class="p">A typical publish/subscribe system has more than one publisher
and more than one subscriber. An application can be both a publisher
and a subscriber. </p>
<p class="p">The provider of information is called a publisher. Publishers supply information about a subject,
   without needing to know anything about the applications that are interested in that information.
   Publishers generate this information in the form of messages, called publications, that they want
   to publish and define the topic of these messages. </p>
<p class="p">The consumer of the information is called a subscriber. Subscribers
create subscriptions that describe the topic that the subscriber is
interested in. Thus, the subscription determines which publications
are forwarded to the subscriber. Subscribers can make multiple subscriptions
and can receive information from many different publishers. </p>
<p class="p">Published information is sent in a JMS or MQTT message, and the
subject of the information is identified by its topic. The publisher
specifies the topic when it publishes the information, and the subscriber
specifies the topics from which it wants to receive publications.
The subscriber is sent information from only those topics it subscribes
to. </p>
<p class="p">The following diagram illustrates the publish/subscribe model.
In the diagram, a publisher publishes a message to a topic. A copy
of that message is received by all three of the subscribers to that
topic.</p>
<p class="p"><img class="image" src="IMA_pub-sub_v2.gif" alt="Diagram illustrating the publish/subscribe model."></p>
<div class="p">The publish and subscribe message model provides the following
benefits: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">The publisher is not required to know who the subscriber is. This
means that the publisher is not required to include the added complexity
of destination information. </li>
<li class="li">The subscriber is de-coupled from the publisher. This de-coupling
is useful as the subscriber receives messages only when they are interested
in a particular topic. The subscriber can subscribe or unsubscribe
from a topic at any point without affecting the publisher.</li>
<li class="li">The messaging topology is dynamic and flexible. Publishers and
subscribers can use the topic structure to quickly broadcast and receive
messages. </li>
<li class="li">Publish/subscribe supports easy deployment and integration.</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="p">You can also use shared subscriptions. Shared subscriptions can
be used to share the work of receiving messages from a topic subscription
between subscribers. Each message is received by only one subscriber
on that shared subscription. For more information about shared subscriptions,
see <a class="xref" href="ov30010.html" title="A subscriber is an application that requests information about a specific topic in a publish/subscribe network. A subscriber receives messages, about the same or different topics, from more than one publisher. A subscription is a request that is sent by the subscriber to receive messages from a relevant topic.">Subscribers
and Subscriptions</a>.</p>

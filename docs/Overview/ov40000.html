<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc"><span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> might
experience outages both planned and unplanned. High availability (HA)
pertains to the ability of messaging services to withstand outages
and continue providing processing capability. </p>
<p class="p">The HA nature of <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> is
its ability to withstand software or hardware outages so that it is
available as much of the time as possible. These outages might be
planned events, such as maintenance and backups, and unplanned events,
such as software failures, hardware failures, power failures, and
disasters.</p>
<div class="p">For <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span>, a pair of servers is identified as:<dl class="dl">
    
     <dt class="dt dlterm">Primary</dt>
     <dd class="dd">The server that is processing messages.</dd>
    
    
     <dt class="dt dlterm">Standby</dt>
     <dd class="dd">The server to which the primary server is replicated.</dd>
    
   </dl></div>
<p class="p">The store of the primary server is replicated to the standby server. The standby server uses the
   replicated data to construct a store that is identical to the store of the active server. The
   standby server monitors the health of the active server. On failure of the active server, the
   standby server activates itself by constructing the <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> server state from the data in the store. </p>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">The primary node fails and the standby node becomes
the new primary node</h2><p class="p">In this scenario, the primary node experiences a failure. The standby node takes over as the new
                primary node. When the old primary restarts, it becomes the new standby node. </p><p class="p">The expectation is that the content of the store and configuration of Server A is preserved and
                that Server B is restarted. No user response is required as failure is detected by
                exceeding the heartbeat timeout. After the heartbeat timeout is exceeded, Server B
                initiates the recovery and then becomes the primary. If  Server A is restarted,
                there is a discovery timeout for Server A to wait for Server B to finish the
                recovery process. It is assumed that Server A was not configured with StartupMode =
                StandAlone. If so, when Server A restarts, it goes into maintenance mode as there is
                already a primary server (Server B) running.</p></section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Replication</h2><p class="p">After the primary and standby nodes are connected and configured, the primary node continually
                replicates both the message store and server configuration information to the
                standby node. If the primary node fails, the standby node has the latest data that
                is needed for applications to continue messaging services. The standby node does not
                accept connections from application clients or provide messaging services until a
                failover operation occurs, which is described in the next section.</p></section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Failover</h2><p class="p">If the standby node detects that
the primary node failed or is unreachable, it performs failover processing
by using information that was replicated from the primary node.  Then,
the standby acts as the primary node to continue messaging services.
 Applications that were connected to the original primary node, can
then connect to the standby node.</p></section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Synchronization</h2><p class="p">When a failed primary node is restarted, it is reconnected as a standby node. The running primary
    node performs a synchronization operation to replicate message store and server configuration
    information from the primary to ensure that the new standby has the latest information to resume
    messaging services. After synchronization, the primary node continues to provide messaging
    services, and the standby is ready to take over in case the primary fails.</p><div class="note note note_note"><span class="note__title">Note:</span> <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">During synchronization, do not make any configuration changes on the node that is restarting and
      becoming the primary. </li>
<li class="li">There is a period in the synchronization operation during which messaging services are suspended
      on both the primary and standby nodes. This suspension can affect applications that are
      connected or trying to connect to the server. Therefore you must ensure that you carefully
      schedule any planned outages of the primary or standby node to minimize the impact of
      synchronization. For example, you might want to start the standby node when the number of
      incoming messages on the primary node is low. Starting the standby node when the load on the
      primary node is low means that messaging on the primary node is paused for just a few seconds.
      This pause is typically less than 5 seconds. If you synchronize the standby node while the
      load on the primary node is high, messaging on the primary node might be paused for a longer
      period. This period is typically 15 - 30 seconds.</li>
<li class="li">During synchronization, configuration change requests are blocked
to ensure that configuration is consistent between the primary and
standby node. Only the following configuration changes are allowed
during synchronization: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li"><span class="keyword cmdname">HighAvailability</span> requests. </li>
<li class="li">Log commands and <span class="keyword cmdname">TraceLevel</span> requests. </li>
<li class="li"><span class="keyword cmdname">LDAP</span> requests.</li>
</ul>If the standby note is stopped and started again while the primary
node is running, any other configuration change requests fail. The
following error message is displayed: <pre class="pre codeblock"><code>HighAvalibility node synchronization process is in progress. Configuration changes are not allowed at this time.</code></pre>After
the HA nodes are synchronized, the configuration change request can
complete. </li>
</ul></div></section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Split brain</h2><p class="p">In an HA pair, there can be
only one primary node providing messaging operations.  If the member
acting as a primary detects that the other server is acting as a primary,
it results in a <dfn class="term">split brain</dfn> condition.</p><div class="p">When the HA pair detects it is in a split brain situation, both nodes are put into maintenance mode, and the administrator must select which member to operate as the primary and the standby nodes. There are situations in which only one node will go down: <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li">While the standby is in the process of becoming a primary, the original primary is able to reconnect to the standby. The standby detects that the primary is still active and goes into maintenance mode. It must be restarted in order to resynchronize and become a standby again. </li>
                <li class="li">When cluster membership is enabled,  the cluster component might detect that there are two servers with the same ServerUID in the cluster. Both nodes of an HA pair use the same ServerUID. In such cases the cluster component terminates the original primary. </li>
                </ul></div>
            <p class="p">Split brain situations are infrequent. You might see a split brain situation after simultaneous outages of both the primary and standby when they are both restarted. </p></section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Application development for high availability</h2><p class="p">Applications that are developed to use with an HA pair of servers can connect to the standby node
    if failover occurs because of an outage of the primary node. Applications must be aware of both
    the primary and standby nodes to take advantage of this.</p><p class="p">For information about

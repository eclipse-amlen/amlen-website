<div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Customers in Austin, Texas, have smart thermostats that enable them to use their phones
        to set their air conditioning and receive notifications from their thermostats.</p>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background to this scenario</h2>

<p class="p">Austin Metro Power® Company instituted a new program enabling them to send emergency requests to                 their customers to avoid a brownout. The company has the ability to send messages                 requesting power usage reductions. The customer's smart thermostats can then                 automatically reduce power usage when the emergency requests are received.</p>

<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Planning and implementing the scenario</h2>

<p class="p">Use the following information to help you plan and implement your <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> cluster

<dd class="dd">
<p class="p">In this scenario, three servers are used to represent a thermostat, a phone, and the data center                             of the fictional Austin Metro Power Company. These three servers are                             configured as a cluster. This scenario tests that the cluster can                             deliver directives and responses and have them display correctly on                             other nodes of the cluster.</p>

<p class="p">This scenario tests that the cluster can deliver directives and responses and have them display
correctly on other nodes of the cluster.</p>
<div class="p">This scenario requires a three-node cluster system:<ul class="sl simple">
<li class="sli"><span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> Server 1, representing
                        the customer's thermostat.</li>

your solution, enter your server, port, client ID, and topic.</p>
<div class="p">
<ol class="ol">
<li class="li">Enable the DemoEndpoint which uses port 16102 on all three servers.</li>
<li class="li">Launch an instance of the MQTT Helper application in three separate browser instances. These

<li class="li">Follow these steps to set up the thermostat node:<ol class="ol" type="a">
<li class="li">In browser 1, enter the server IP and Port of server 1, then click

                            responses, and watch them be received by subscribers who are connected
                            to different servers in the cluster.</p><p class="p">In this scenario, Jim left
                            hurriedly for work on Monday morning, and forgot to adjust his
                            air-conditioning temperature before leaving home. His parents are
                            visiting, and he wants his home to be comfortable for them. From his
                            remote work location, Jim sends a directive to his thermostat to set the
                            air-conditioning temperature to 22°C (72°F). The thermostat receives the
                            directive and responds accordingly to set the temperature to 22°C
                            (72°F). The thermostat then publishes a response notifying Jim that the
                            temperature has been set to 22°C (72°F). Jim's phone receives the
                            response from Jim's thermostat.</p></li>

<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Background to this scenario</h2><p class="p">A company wants
to be able to complete remote emergency shutdowns on machines that
are located within its various factories. A request is published from
a centralized back-end system that runs in the company intranet, and
a response is required from each machine to confirm that the shutdown
is complete. The back-end application is a publisher and subscriber
device on the intranet. The machines are publisher and subscriber
devices on the intranet. <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> sits
within the intranet. Complete the steps in the following section to
understand how to set up this scenario.</p></section>
<section class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Planning and implementing the solution</h2><p class="p">Use
the following information to help you to plan and implement a fan-out
per device request-reply scenario.</p><dl class="dl">
<dt class="dt dlterm">Understanding your publish/subscribe architecture</dt>
<dd class="dd"><p class="p">In this scenario, one publisher device publishes messages to
many topic strings. Each message has only one subscriber device. Each
subscriber device publishes reply messages to the publisher device.
This scenario is a fan-out per device request-reply. The following
diagram shows the architecture of a fan-out per device request-reply
scenario.<img class="image" src="../Planning/ov00101d_v2.gif" alt="Fan-out per device request-reply diagram. One publisher device publishes messages to many topic strings. Each message has only one subscriber device. Each subscriber device publishes reply messages to the publisher device."></p></dd>

<dt class="dt dlterm">Understanding the required messaging behavior for your solution</dt>
<dd class="dd"><p class="p">Do you want durable or non-durable subscriptions? What quality
of service do you need?</p><p class="p">If a subscription is durable, when the
subscribing application disconnects, the subscription remains in place
and can be used by the subscribing application when it reconnects.
In this scenario, the subscriptions are durable because it is important
that the devices receive the request and response messages even if
the connection is lost. </p><p class="p">A quality of service of 1 is appropriate
because the message delivery across the network must be guaranteed
at least once. It is acceptable to have duplicates as any duplicates
can be discarded. QoS 1 messages are persistent. The message is stored
on <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> until
the message is received by the subscriber of the message. </p></dd>

<dt class="dt dlterm">Planning your solution</dt>
<dd class="dd"><div class="p">In this scenario, consider the following key points: <ul class="ul">
<li class="li">Which protocol is appropriate? <p class="p"><span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span>
          natively supports MQTT and JMS. You can also install your own protocol by using the
          protocol plug-in.  You must consider which protocol is appropriate for your business
          needs. The amount of data that is sent between the devices is small. The messages between
          the devices must be sent reliably. The MQTT protocol is designed for exchanging messages
          between small devices on low bandwidth, or expensive connections, and to send messages
          reliably. Therefore, MQTT protocol is appropriate in this scenario. </p></li>
<li class="li">What message size is appropriate?<p class="p">In this scenario, the back-end
appliance and the machines send small, persistent messages. The information
that is contained within the message is about shutting down. Therefore,
the message can be relatively small. You can limit the message size
that is allowed to be sent through <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> by using
the maximum message size attribute of an endpoint. For more information
about endpoints, see <a class="xref" href="../Overview/ov00060.html" title="Message hubs are an organizational configuration object that collects endpoints, connection policies, and messaging policies that are associated with a specific goal into a single place. You can create a message hub per application to organize the endpoints and policies each application uses.">Message hub, endpoints, and policies</a>.</p></li>
<li class="li">What message count is appropriate?<p class="p">Consider what maximum message
count is sensible for your messaging needs. In this scenario, the
quality of service is 1, so messages are stored until a subscriber
receives the message. Therefore, a higher message count might typically
be considered. However, as each device publishes and subscribes to
unique topic strings, a lower maximum message count is sufficient.</p></li>
<li class="li">What is the maximum number of topic levels that you need?<p class="p">You
can have up to 32 levels in a topic string. Fewer levels are easier
to manage, but many levels might be required to set up specific solutions.
In this scenario, the topic string length can be relatively short.
For example, <code class="ph codeph">Shutdown/Request/DeviceID</code> or <code class="ph codeph">Shutdown/Response/DeviceID</code>. </p> </li>
<li class="li">How are you going to ensure that all of your client IDs are unique?<p class="p">In
this scenario, it is crucial that all client IDs are unique so that
the shutdown response from each machine is recorded against the correct
machine. For example, you might decide to use the device ID as that
number is unique to each machine. Therefore in this scenario the client
ID is set to be the device ID of the machine. </p></li>
<li class="li">What message depth is appropriate?<p class="p">You can specify the maximum message depth by setting the
          maximum message count attribute of a topic policy. When the maximum message depth is
          reached, you cannot publish any more messages to that topic string until the number of
          messages is reduced. However, as each machine publishes and subscribes to unique topic
          strings, the maximum message depth does not need to be as large as it would be if all
          machines published and subscribed to the same topic string. </p></li>
</ul></div><p class="p">For more information about planning your solution, see <a class="xref" href="../Planning/pl00001_.html" title="When you plan your Eclipse Amlen solution, you must make a number of decisions to ensure your solution works effectively.">Planning</a>.</p></dd>

<dt class="dt dlterm">Writing your applications</dt>
<dd class="dd"><p class="p">In this scenario, you must decide the name of the topic strings
that you are publishing and subscribing to. The company needs many
topic strings because they are sending requests to, and receiving
responses from many machines. For this messaging pattern, the machines
publish and subscribe to their unique topic strings. By using the
unique client ID in the topic string, you can ensure that each topic
is unique. All response topic strings must be subscribed to by the
intranet device. </p><p class="p">To ensure that machines do not publish to an incorrect topic string, you can use the topic string
       variable substitution available in the <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span> topic policies. By using topic
       string variable substitution, you can create a topic policy with single topic string that
       includes a client ID variable. This substitution ensures that applications can publish and
       subscribe only to the topic string that matches their client ID. For example, a topic string
       of <code class="ph codeph">Shutdown/Response/${ClientID}</code> is specified in the topic policy. The
       application with a client ID of 123 is allowed to publish to
        <code class="ph codeph">Shutdown/Response/123</code>, but is not allowed to publish to
        <code class="ph codeph">Shutdown/Response/456</code>, or <code class="ph codeph">Shutdown/Response/789</code> because
       the client ID does not match. For more information about topic policies and variable
       substitution, see <a class="xref" href="../Security/se00004_.html" title="You can use messaging policies to authorize client messaging. There are three types of messaging policies: Topic policies, queue policies, and subscription policies.">Messaging policies</a>.</p><p class="p">You can also use the topic string variable substitution to ensure that applications do not
       subscribe to an incorrect topic string. For example, if you specify a topic string of
        <code class="ph codeph">Shutdown/Request/${ClientID}</code> in the topic policy, then only the application
       with a client ID of 123 is allowed to subscribe to <code class="ph codeph">Shutdown/Request/123</code>.</p><p class="p">In
this scenario, the name of the request topic string is <code class="ph codeph">Shutdown/Request/${ClientID}</code>.
The name of the response topic string is <code class="ph codeph">Shutdown/Response/${ClientID}</code>.</p><p class="p">The
order in which your applications perform publish and subscribe actions
is important. Both the client and the back-end application must subscribe
to the relevant topic string before any messages are published. Otherwise,
messages might be published but not received as no subscription was
set up at the time that the message was published. </p><p class="p">The following
diagram shows this message flow between client and back-end devices
through <span class="ph">Eclipse Amlen</span>. <img class="image" src="sc00004c_v2.gif" alt="Message flow between client and back-end devices."></p><div class="p"><ol class="ol">
